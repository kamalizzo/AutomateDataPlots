# AutomateDataPlots
 Process raw data and generate plots for thesis purpose.

Current Implementation:
1) Generate raw data in xlsx file
2) Generate measurement and I-U curves (polarization curves) plots only

To be implemented:
1) EISData class for EIS spectra plots (Nyquist and Bode) 
2) EISSimData class for simulated plots from equivalent circuit
