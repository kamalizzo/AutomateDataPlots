# AutomateDataPlots
 Process raw data and generate plots for thesis purpose.
 Run the main.py to process data.

Current Implementation:
1) Generate raw data in xlsx file
2) Generate measurement and I-U curves (polarization curves) plots
3) Generate EIS spectra plots (Nyquist and Bode) 
4) Generate table consisting appropriate gas flow and water vapor flow based on current measuring point, relative humidity and stoichiometry.

To be implemented:
2) EISSimData class for simulated plots from equivalent circuit

Packages/dependencies:
1) pandas
2) matplotlib
3) numpy
